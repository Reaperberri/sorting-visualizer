# Sorting Visualizer
A sorting visualizer made in Python with Pygame.
**This project is very much a work-in-progress**

# Running
Install the required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the main file:

`python main.py`

# Usage
Press *Enter* to start a bubble sort.

Press *Escape* to quit.

# Modifying
On `main.py` you can call `SortVisualizer(800, 500)` with different parameters.
The first parameter is window width, the second is window height, and the optional third is delay.
The more you decrease the delay, the faster the visualization will run.
